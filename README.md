# Asset Management Demo (Upwork Showcase)

This repository is a frontend demo project I use to showcase my work on Upwork. It presents a resource/asset management interface with dashboards, maps, and data visualizations.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Next.js
- Ant Design (antd)
- ECharts
- MapLibre GL JS

## Mock API

All API requests are mocked using Vercel Serverless functions to simulate backend behavior.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
